# Robotic Arm Payload Analysis and Servo Motor Recommendations

This documentation analyzes the torque requirements for a robotic arm lifting payloads of 1 kg and 2 kg. It also provides servo motor recommendations and discusses the use of gear systems for increasing lifting capacity, along with potential challenges and solutions.

## Case 1: Lifting 1 kg

**Payload Mass:** 1 kg  
**Force:** 1 × 9.81 = 9.81 N

Torque (Nm) = Force (N) × Distance (m)

Force = Playload Mass × Gravity = m × 9.81

| Joint    | Distance from Load (m)| Torque Required (Nm)|
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Wrist    | 0.04                  | 0.3924              |
| Elbow    | 0.14                  | 1.3734              |
| Shoulder | 0.29                  | 2.8449              |

### Recommended Servo Motors

| Joint    | Required Torque | Suitable Servo Motor        | Rated Torque   |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------|
| Wrist    | 0.39 Nm         | MG996R                     | ~0.9–1.0 Nm     |
| Elbow    | 1.37 Nm         | DS3218 Digital Servo       | ~2.0–2.2 Nm     |
| Shoulder | 2.84 Nm         | Dynamixel MX-28 / JX 6221MG| ~2.5–3.5 Nm     |

**Conclusion:**  
These motors are sufficient to lift 1 kg without additional gear mechanisms.

## Case 2: Lifting 2 kg

**Payload Mass:** 2 kg  
**Force:** 2 × 9.81 = 19.62 N

| Joint    | Distance from Load (m) | Torque Required (Nm) |
|----------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Wrist    | 0.04                  | 0.7848              |
| Elbow    | 0.14                  | 2.7468              |
| Shoulder | 0.29                  | 5.6898              |

### Recommended Servo Motors

| Joint    | Required Torque | Suitable Servo Motor            | Rated Torque   |
|----------|-----------------|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Wrist    | 0.78 Nm         | DS3218 Digital Servo           | ~2.0–2.2 Nm     |
| Elbow    | 2.75 Nm         | JX PDI-6221MG / DS3225         | ~3.5–4.5 Nm     |
| Shoulder | 5.69 Nm         | Dynamixel MX-64 / JX PDI-6225MG| ~6.0–7.0 Nm     |

**Conclusion:**  
Heavier-duty servos are required to safely lift 2 kg.

## Gear Systems 

Using gear reduction systems can increase the output torque, enabling the robotic arm to lift heavier loads.

**Example:**  
A gear ratio of 3:1 triples the torque but reduces the speed to one-third.

## Disadvantages of Using Gears

| Issue         | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reduced Speed | Higher torque results in lower rotational speed.             |
| Backlash      | Slack in gears reduces motion precision.                     |
| Bulkiness     | Gears increase the size and weight of the arm.               |
| Complexity    | Adds mechanical and design complexity.                       |
| Noise         | Gear systems may produce noise, especially if misaligned.    |

## Challenges When Lifting 2 kg

- Motor overheating due to high torque demand  
- Reduced battery life from increased current draw  
- Instability or vibration when holding the load  
- Limited accuracy from servo stress and backlash  
- Mechanical wear from repeated heavy lifting  

## Solutions

| Problem            | Solution                                                    |
|------------------- |-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Insufficient torque| Use high-torque servos or stepper motors with gearboxes     |
| Overheating        | Use heat sinks, fans, or reduce duty cycle                  |
| Inaccuracy         | Use digital servos with feedback and reduce backlash        |
| Instability        | Reinforce arm structure and use counterweights if needed    |
| Power consumption  | Upgrade batteries or use regulated power supplies           |

## Final Notes

- Use gear systems strategically where speed can be sacrificed for torque.  
- Select servos or actuators based on the heaviest expected load and longest reach.  
- Consider future improvements such as feedback systems, force sensors, or automated balancing.
